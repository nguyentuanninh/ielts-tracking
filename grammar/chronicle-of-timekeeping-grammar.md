## 2. Explanations & Functions

1. According to ... : Cites source/authority; frames information as evidence-based.
2. Parallel infinitives: Shows organized multi-goal purpose list; rhythmic emphasis.
3. Past participial phrase 'marked by...': Compresses relative clause to add defining detail.
4. Complex noun phrase: Dense packaging of idea (ownership + abstract + prepositional phrase).
5. Comparative 'more ... than ...': Highlights salience difference (moon phases vs seasons).
6. Fronted time clause: Establishes temporal context before main clause; comma separates.
7. Passive relative: Focus on product (calendars) not agents; academic objectivity.
8. Where-clause: Provides situational condition (geographical/agricultural context).
9. Perfect participial: Action completed before main narrative time; sequencing.
10. Passive + infinitive of purpose: Concise purpose without explicit agent.
11. Reduced passive relative: Streamlines description (avoid 'which were').
12. Concessive 'Although': Signals contrast between satisfactory performance and limitation.
13. Nominalization 'the question of when': Abstracts issue; formal style.
14. Divide ... into ...: Standardization process; mathematical framing.
15. Passive 'were superseded': Emphasizes technological progression; agent unimportant.
16. Perfect participle 'having been': Long prior existence relative to later innovation.
17. Fronted contrast 'Unlike...': Explicit comparison; must align subjects logically.
18. Purpose/result chain with 'so that': Mechanistic explanation of function.
19. Present participial result 'allowing': Shows consequence of previous action (anchor design).
20. Inversion 'So integral have ... become that': Emphatic result; formal dramatic tone.
21. 'Only when' clause: Restricts recognition; pragmatic emphasis on dependency.

## 3. Common B1 Pitfalls

1. Misuse 'according with' instead of 'according to'.
2. Dropping 'to' in parallel infinitives after first item.
3. Adding 'which is' before past participle phrase (unnecessary).
4. Splitting complex noun phrase with extra 'that'.
5. Double comparative ('more more').
6. Missing comma after fronted time clause.
7. Omitting 'that' incorrectly or mis-ordering passive structure.
8. Using 'which' where 'where' needed for location context.
9. Confusing perfect participle vs present participle (missing time sequence).
10. Inserting subject before infinitive of purpose ('to it approximate').
11. Writing 'which were inscribed' redundantly.
12. Using 'but' after 'although'.
13. Saying 'the question about when start' (tense/form errors).
14. Forgetting 'into' or wrong preposition ('divide to').
15. Using active 'superseded' without 'were'.
16. Using simple past 'was around' losing ongoing duration nuance.
17. Dangling 'Unlike' causing mismatch subjects.
18. Replacing 'so that' with 'for' incorrectly.
19. Misattached -ing phrase (unclear subject for 'allowing').
20. Keeping normal order after 'so integral' (missing inversion for emphasis).
21. Misplacing 'only' ('when they only fail').

## 4. Upgrade Tips

1. Vary sources: 'On the basis of', 'Based on archaeological evidence,'.
2. Practice triads of infinitives for academic tone.
3. Convert relative clauses to participial phrases to reduce wordiness.
4. Build layered noun phrases (possessive + abstract + prep phrase) for density.
5. Use comparative patterns: 'far more', 'significantly more'.
6. Front time/place clauses to guide reader contextually.
7. Choose passive to foreground processes/products in formal writing.
8. Employ where/when clauses to condense defining information.
9. Use perfect participle to signal prior completed stage: 'Having completed the survey, ...'.
10. Express purpose succinctly: 'data added to ensure accuracy'.
11. Remove redundant 'which' to streamline.
12. Contrast elegantly: 'Although X, Y still...'.
13. Nominalize key issues: 'the challenge of', 'the need for'.
14. Quantify processes with 'divide / classify / categorize'.
15. Signal progression: 'were gradually superseded by'.
16. Highlight duration with present perfect constructions.
17. Ensure parallel subjects after contrast openers.
18. Link mechanism to effect: 'so that', 'thereby', 'thus'.
19. Use -ing phrases for concise result: '..., reducing errors.'
20. Inversion for emphasis sparingly to elevate tone.
21. Front 'Only when...' + inversion for stronger emphasis in formal writing.

## 5. Mini Practice (Placeholders)

A. Transform: Replace the relative clause with a participial phrase: 'The calendars which were developed...' -> ********\_\_\_\_********.
B. Write an emphatic inversion starting with 'So' about technology dependence.
C. Combine: 'The device was redesigned. It reduced friction.' using an -ing phrase.
D. Nominalize: Turn 'When should we begin counting?' into a noun phrase.
E. Purpose: Rephrase 'They added five days so that they could approximate the solar year.' removing explicit subject of purpose.
