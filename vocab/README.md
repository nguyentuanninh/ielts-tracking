# Vocab Lists

Purpose: Curated vocabulary by theme or source (IELTS readings, topics).

Conventions:

- Prefer one thematic list per file.
- Use either Markdown blocks (see sample) or structured JSON if programmatic usage anticipated.
- Keep examples authentic, <=20 words.

Sample Markdown entry:

```
### word: sustainable
- pos: adjective | CEFR: B2 | IPA: /səˈsteɪnəbl/
- Meaning: able to continue over a period without damaging the environment
- Collocations: sustainable development; sustainable practices
- Example: Many companies invest in sustainable energy solutions.
```
